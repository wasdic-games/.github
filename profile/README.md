# WASDIC Games

Welcome at the GitHub profile of WASDIC Games. The name is derived from the WASD keys that every gamer knows so well. Currently, WADSIC Games is not a company, but just a nickname for my game development projects. If you would like to get in touch, feel free to use the social media channels provided.
